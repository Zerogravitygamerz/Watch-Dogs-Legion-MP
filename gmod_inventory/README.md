# Garry's Mod Inventory Addon

This addon implements a simple inventory system inspired by FiveM. Press **Tab** in-game to open the inventory UI. Players can drag and drop weapon icons between slots and their positions will be saved between sessions.

## Installation
1. Place the `gmod_inventory` folder inside your server's `garrysmod/addons` directory.
2. Start the server. The addon will automatically load.

The inventory data is stored in the `data/wd_inventory/` directory on the server as JSON files named after each player's SteamID64.
